I use self-raising flour in a lot in my recipes and one question I get asked quite regularly is how they can be adapted to be made from plain or all-purpose flour with added baking powder. Self-rising flour makes impossibly fluffy pancakes, sky-high biscuits and muffins that rival any bakery&#39;s. But it&#39;s not all that common in recipes, plus it has a short shelf life, so stocking up isn&#39;t really worth it. The simplest description of self-rising flour is flour that has baking powder and salt added to it. Typically, self-rising flour is also made using a slightly lower-protein flour than all-purpose flour.
