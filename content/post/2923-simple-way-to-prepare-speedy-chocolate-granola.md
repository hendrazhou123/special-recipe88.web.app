Hey everyone, it's me, Dave, welcome to my recipe site. Today, we're going to prepare a special dish, chocolate granola. One of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I'm gonna make it a bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Chocolate Granola is one of the most popular of recent trending foods in the world. It's appreciated by millions daily. It's simple, it is quick, it tastes delicious. Chocolate Granola is something that I've loved my entire life. They're fine and they look wonderful.

Find Deals on Chocolate Granola in Food &amp; Snacks on Amazon. If you want a stickier granola, that will more easily clump together, you can up the brown sugar and maple syrup a bit, as I used the bare minimum in this recipe, but I think it&#39;s plenty sweet enough, especially if you&#39;re a fan of dark chocolate. Sprinkle with the remaining turbinado sugar and coarse sea salt to taste.


To get started with this particular recipe, we must first prepare a few components. You can cook chocolate granola using 6 ingredients and 2 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.

##### Steps to make Chocolate Granola:

1. Preheat the oven to 325°F. Line a large baking tray with parchment paper and set it aside
1. In a large bowl, stir everything together until thoroughly combined and the oats are all moistened. Spread the oat mixture onto the baking tray and bake for 25 or so minutes, until it&#39;s starting to dry out. Then remove the tray from the oven and let it sit out to crisp up. Once its cooled, transfer it to an airtight container. Store for up to 1 week.


To a food processor (or mixing bowl), add the oats, nuts, coconut, chia seeds, coconut sugar, salt, and cocoa powder. Pulse a few times (or stir) to combine. In a large bowl, combine the oats, wheat germ, cereal and cornmeal. A simple mix of chocolate chips and chocolate covered raisins is added to the granola after it bakes - to avoid burning any chocolate. While the granola is still warm, add in the chocolate chips and give them a nice stir.
