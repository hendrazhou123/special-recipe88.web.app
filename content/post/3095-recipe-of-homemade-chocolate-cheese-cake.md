It is creamy and rich…almost like a dense chocolate mousse, but BETTER! The Oreo crust really pairs beautifully with the creamy chocolate filling, and I topped t all off with an easy chocolate ganache! For the Ultimate Chocolate Cheesecake: Fill a medium pot one-third full with water and bring it to a low simmer over medium heat. Place a heatproof bowl that will fit on top of the pan snugly, but will not touch the simmering water, on top of the pan. Reduce the heat to low and add the chopped chocolate into the bowl over the pot.
