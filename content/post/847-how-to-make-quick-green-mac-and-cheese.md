We figured out a way to eat your greens while eating macaroni and cheese. MUNCHIES Culinary Director, Farideh Sadeghin, shows us how to make this. Leeks, broccolini and spinach add color and nutrition to this cheesy pasta, which gets a dose of crunch from a toasted almond topping. This mac and cheese recipe from Jamie Oliver&#39;s latest cookbook is full of greenery—like spinach, leek, and broccolini. &#34;Swap spinach out for any kind of exciting fresh or frozen greens, discarding any tough stalks. I also sometimes add breadcrumbs to the top for bonus crunch.
