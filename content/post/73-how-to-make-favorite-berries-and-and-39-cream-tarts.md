recipeinstructions:
- "Thaw puff pastry on the counter, then put one sheet on top of the other and press the two together by rolling gently with a rolling pin until about 12x16 inches in size. Do not flour in between. Doubling the sheets will produce higher borders on the tarts. Cut out circles with a 3 inch cookie cutter. Try to cut them out as close as possible, leaving minimal amount of scraps in between."
- "Remove scraps to a different parchment lined baking sheet. Move each cut out circle about 3/4 inch from each other. Using a 2 inch cookie cutter, press it in the middle of the circle, almost all the way through."
- "Whisk the eggs together for the egg wash.Using a pastry brush, brush the tops of each circle as well as the scraps that were leftover."
- "Generously sprinkle tops of the cutout circles with granulated sugar."
- "Bake in preheated to 425°F for 15 minutes or until puffed up and golden in colour."
- "For the Ganache: Heat 1/2 cup heavy cream until almost boiling. Pour over 1/2 cup of dark chocolate chips. Let sit for 2-3 minutes. Stir until smooth."
- "Line a cup with a sandwich size ziplock bag and pour the ganache in."
- "For the cream: Combine 2 cups heavy cream, 2/3 cup sugar &amp; 1 Tbsp vanilla in a bowl of an electric mixer."
- "Whip on high until stiff. Fill a pastry bag or a gallon sized ziplock bag fitted with a large star tip with the cream. Refrigerate until ready to use. Try to use within 15 minutes of making it."
- "Line a large glass or a vase with the pastry bag fitted with a star tip (or a ziplock bag). Set aside."
- "As soon as the pastries are baked and out of the oven, with your fingers or with a smaller cookie cutter, press in the middle to bring it down, leaving the sides as the borders to our pastries. Let completely cool."
- "Snip off the end of the ziplock bag with the chocolate ganache and generously drizzle inside of the tarts, leaving about 1/4 of the ganache to drizzle later on top as decoration"
- "Fill the pastry bag with the reserved cream and then use it to fill the middle with cream as well."
- "Now slice the strawberries lengthwise and place one on each tart. Using leftover ganache, drizzle each tart."
- "These pastries are best served cold, right out of the fridge. Enjoy!"
