recipeingredient:
- "3 lb London Broil"
- "3/4 Cup Soy Sauce"
- "3/4 Cup Worcestershire Sauce"
- "1 Cup Light or Dark Brown Sugar"
- "1/4 Cup Mustard"
- "1 Tbsp Black Pepper"
- "1 Tsp Kosher Salt"
- "1 Tbsp crushed red pepper flakes"
recipeinstructions:
- "Slice London broil 1/8 inch thick and set aside."
- "Whisk soy sauce, worcestershire, brown sugar, mustard, kosher salt, black pepper &amp; red pepper flakes briskly until brown sugar is dissolved."
- "Place half of the sliced london broil into gallon sized ziplock bag then half of marinade mixture. Seal up bag and agitate until all pieces of beef are covered. Then add the rest of the beef and marinade. Agitate again to cover."
- "Refrigerate overnight. 6 hours minimum. 24 hours max."
- "Pellet/Stick Smoker Instructions:. Preheat to 145-155 degrees. Use Mesquite wood for a deep robust smoky flavor, Hickory for savory smoke flavor, or your favorite fruit wood for a lighter smoke taste."
- "Shake off excess marinade and pat down with paper towel. Set strips of beef directly on rack. Make sure adequate spacing. Since we are dehydrating the beef, you need to have adequate air flow in between pieces. The tighter the spacing, the longer the cook time."
- "Gas Grill Directions:. Heat your gas grill on low. Usually one burner will get you to desired temp of 145-155. Use a smoking box or wood pellet coil as directed by manufacturer."
- "Smoke until strips of beef shred apart when flexing. Do not overcook to point where beef strips snap in half. The strips should want to bend back to position."
