There&#39;s just something about a creamy, dense lemon filling topped with sour cream, settled on top of a graham cracker crust. On a Lemon Pie, to my way of thinking, or any pie really, a meringue topping should be soft and almost marshmallow like.

This easy Lemon Pie is light, creamy, sweet and tart lemon pie with a thick graham cracker crust. I think I might have been the last person in this world to watch the show Fixer Upper with Chip and Joanna Gaines. If you haven&#39;t seen the show, run and watch it now and you&#39;ll immediately. Spoiler: This is way easier than making a pie crust. The Italian classic is reimagined as a pie and we&#39;re not mad about it.
