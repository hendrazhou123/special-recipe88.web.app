My love of the chocolate-peanut butter combination continues to grow every day and this took it to a new level. I&#39;ll admit I was a bit worried that the peanut butter flavor would be too strong, but the mousse is lightened up nicely with the whipped cream so the filling is rich and silky. Peanut Butter Mousse is dangerous to have in your refrigerator. You may find yourself sneaking spoonfuls or maybe even dipping cookies into it. Not that I know from experience or anything… Not only is this recipe easy, but it&#39;s versatile too.
