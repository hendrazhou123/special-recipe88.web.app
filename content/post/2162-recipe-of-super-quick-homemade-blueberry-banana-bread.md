More banana bread variations I love are Banana Cranberry Bread, Roasted Strawberry Banana Bread, and Maple Pecan Banana Muffins. This Blueberry Banana Bread is full of fresh juicy blueberries in every bite. I had a box of fresh blueberries that I used, but you can also use frozen blueberries if that is what you have on hand. Just use whatever is easiest for you to get this bread in your oven ASAP. In this current heat, bananas ripen faster.
