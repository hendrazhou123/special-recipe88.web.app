- " vegetable or peanut oil for frying"
- " tongs for turning chicken safely"
recipeinstructions:
- "Mix all brine ingredients in a large bowl and stir or whisk until all the salt and sugar have been dissolved."
- "In a large mixing bowl, combine the chicken with yogurt brine and gently toss and massage everything together until the brine is evenly distributed throughout. It&#39;s a good idea to check each individual piece of chicken to ensure it&#39;s been thoroughly coated."
- "Refrigerate the chicken and let it brine/marinate for at least 2 hours and up to 24 hours."
- "45 minutes before frying, take the chicken out of the fridge and let it come up in temperature. While it&#39;s doing that, prepare the dredge by combining all dredge ingredients in a large mixing bowl or casserole dish and stirring or whisking several times to evenly distribute all the seasonings."
- "10 to 15 minutes before frying, fill your large pot or pan (I like to use my wok, but you can use a Dutch or French oven, or a deep-ish cast iron skillet) to about 2/3 capacity with frying oil and preheat the oil over medium high heat to 350F to 365F. If you don&#39;t have a thermometer, you&#39;ll know the oil is ready for frying as soon as a good pinch of flour dropped in sizzles gently but immediately."
- "Line a sheet pan or large platter with a brown paper bag or a double layer of paper towels and set it on the counter next to the stove."
- "Working in batches of 3 to 4 pieces, coat the chicken completely with the dredge, shake off the excess, and gently slide the chicken into your oil. And again, if that flour doesn&#39;t begin to gently and immediately sizzle upon hitting that oil, resist the urge to let it fry anyway, and let the oil come up in temp before you put the chicken in."
- "I like to put similarly sized/same type pieces in together, largest ones first. That way, a) each batch finishes cooking at roughly the same time and b) the larger pieces that have been fried first will retain heat longer while the smaller pieces are finishing up."
- "Generally speaking, I find that thighs take longest - 15 to 18 minutes total, 7.5 to 9 minutes per side, and drums, whole wings, and breast pieces take 12 to 15 minutes total, 6 to 7.5 minutes per side. Don&#39;t forget to flip midway! :)"
- "When it&#39;s time to take the chicken out, using your tongs, gently shake off excess oil, and set it on your lined sheet pan or platter. And that&#39;s it! Looks like a lot, but it&#39;s pretty simple. The yogurt really does help to make moist, tender, flavorful fried chicken. :)"
- "Enjoy! :)"
