Chocolate Glaze: We&#39;re using the same chocolate glaze as we do for my banana donuts. It&#39;s like chocolate ganache, but we use butter. Butter helps it solidify and &#34;set&#34; on top of each donut. Taste: This is hands down the best chocolate glaze ever. It actually tastes like chocolate and is wonderfully luscious and thick.
