recipeingredient:
- "5 tbsp flour"
- "1 cup whole milk"
- "1 tsp vanilla"
- "1 cup granulated sugar"
- "1 cup butter room temperature"
recipeinstructions:
- "Combine milk and flour in a sauce pan. Whisk them together until well combined. Heat until the mixture thickens stirring continuously and it will be thick, thick, thick."
- "Let the frosting cool completely. This is important! If you are in a hurry, place the sauce pan over a bed of ice in the sink (about 10 minutes)."
- "Once the flour/milk mixture has cooled add the vanilla and stir well."
- "Using a mixer, beat the sugar and butter together. I scrape the side of the bowl several times and beat some more (about two times)."
- "Now add the flour/milk/vanilla mixture to the mixing bowl. Beat the crap out of it until it resembles whipped cream. You don&#39;t want any sugar graininess in the frosting. In the blog, several reviews stated they had a hard time getting the graininess out. I haven&#39;t had that problem. Somehow after I add the flour mixture it magically goes away."
- "Frost your delicious chocolate cake or cake of your choosing and do the taste test. Take a moment and enjoy this new found greatness."
