Unlike that bakery muffin, though, you can help yourself to seconds. Slice the cake and serve with the citrus curd whipped cream. This poppy seed cake is super lemony! It has Lemon Curd in the frosting and between the cake layers and the cake batter is infused with lemon juice and lemon zest. I make this every year at Christmas adding a teaspoon of cardamom to make a delicious cardamom-poppy seed cake.
