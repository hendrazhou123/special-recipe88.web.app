- "Once cooled completely, transfer to glass containers and store in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks, sometimes more (depending on the freshness of your ingredients). Freeze for 1 month."
- "Enjoy straight from the fridge, or let it warm to room temperature before adding to item of choice I like to spread it on buttered toast and its good on waffles, oatmeal, yoghurt, baked sweat potatoes, pancakes, in your coffee with cream to make a Latte or as a cookie dip with cream cheese."
