What&#39;s better than a sirloin steak cooked to perfection on the grill? Here is what I do I take garlic clove mince them then add salt on them and run knife over them back and forth until paste is formed then and to butter(not melted)I throw in chopped fresh parsley and refrigorate. When your steak is done, DO NOT cut into it right away. It&#39;s super hot, and all the fat and juices are just running amok in there. Succulent porterhouse steaks seared to perfection, and basted liberally with a garlic and herb infused butter.
