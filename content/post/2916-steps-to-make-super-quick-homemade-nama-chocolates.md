Store the chocolates between sheets of butter or parchment paper in airtight containers in the fridge. It can be stored in the freezer too and thaw in fridge when needed."
- "Use the best quality of chocolate which is at least 60% but not grated than 75% or they will turn bitter!  If you are not a fan of dark chocolate, you can use milk chocolate too.  If the bars tend to melt while cutting, return to fridge for a few minutes and then continue to cut.  Best enjoyed fresh, within a week. Enjoy!!"
