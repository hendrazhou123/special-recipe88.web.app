##### The ingredients needed to make Brownie Chocolates:

1. Make ready 1 bowl chocolate brownie crumble
1. Get 1 cup chopped white chocolate compound


In a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat the eggs at medium speed until fluffy and light yellow. The secret to a really great brownie is using both melted chocolate AND cocoa powder, plus butter instead of oil (because butter has way better flavour than oil). The combination of these plus minimal flour, just enough to make a barely-set batter, and brown sugar rather than white (for extra moisture and chewiness) is what will deliver that. Add boiling water; stir until well blended.
