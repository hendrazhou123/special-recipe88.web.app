- "For yeast activation take 1/2 cup warm water. Make sure the water is just warm and not hot (to test that, dip your finger in the water. If it is comfortable and does not feel burning, then it&#39;s optimum temperature). Mix sugar and yeast in the water and keep it for 5-10 min, till it begins to foam.
