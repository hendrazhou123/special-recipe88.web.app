##### The ingredients needed to make Chocolatee pudDing🍮🍮:

1. Get 1 pudding paCket (Rafhan)
1. Take half kg milk


Most rely on boxed instant pudding mix, but when the recipe specifies prepared pudding, you can use homemade if you prefer. Chilling pudding quickly: If you want to chill the pudding very quickly, pour it into a large shallow sheet pan. (Don&#39;t forget to cover the whole surface with plastic or wax paper, or you&#39;ll end up with a lot of pudding skin!) Creamy pudding: After pudding has thoroughly chilled, I like to whisk it or beat it in my mixer before serving. Chocolate pudding pie is a three-generation family favorite for us, so I am really picky about how I make it. This recipe is smooth, creamy, not too sweet when made properly.
