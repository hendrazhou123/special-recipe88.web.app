Peanut butter and jelly is a classic American flavour combination, so we&#39;ve made peanut butter and jelly scones. Split the scones (still warm is best), spread with a little more smooth peanut butter, and smear with raspberry jelly and a little clotted cream, if you like, before eating. Add the butter and use a pastry cutter to cut them together until they resemble coarse crumbs. Just give the glaze a chance to set up, then the scones are good to go! Where &#34;good to go&#34; means &#34;dig into.
