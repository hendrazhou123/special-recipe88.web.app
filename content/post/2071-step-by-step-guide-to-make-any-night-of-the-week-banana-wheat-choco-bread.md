Banana bread has always been one of our favorites and my kids didn&#39;t even notice when I switched my old recipe for this one. I know that they are small changes (and there are definitely healthier snack choices out there), but making lifestyle changes happens one little step at a time. what could i replace.

I wanted this bread to fall under that category as well; however, I had never experimented with whole wheat flour in banana bread, nor unrefined sweeteners so I figured I would try something. Whole wheat banana bread with no refined sugar- the sweetness comes from the bananas and the honey! This banana bread makes a great breakfast or healthy snack. This whole wheat banana bread is made without oil and butter. Rather, applesauce is used to give the bread moisture.
