Dried, salted cod (bacalhau) and potatoes in a rich cream sauce is a traditional Portuguese dish. Here in Portugal we call it &#34;Bacalhau com natas&#34;, a truelly fantastic recipe in my humble opinion, we have a special cheese called &#34;Quijo da Ilha&#34; its a very strong flavoured cheese, but if you cant find. This pasta sauce is lower in fat than most yet still very creamy! If you like artichokes, you&#39;ll like this!
