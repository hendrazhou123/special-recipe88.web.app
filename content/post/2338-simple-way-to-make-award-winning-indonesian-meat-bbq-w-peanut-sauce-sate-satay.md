Boneless chicken meat is marinated in a soy sauce mixture, cooked on the grill, and served with a delicious peanut sauce. This is an original Indonesian satay. I send it from a long way. A delicious Indonesian dish has a lovely sweet-and-savory flavors, and the skewered, grilled lamb is beyond succulent.

I always love eating such saucy dishes with rice because the rice soaks up the sauce, and that means the dish continues to Serve the meat over hot rice with the peanut sauce. Satay (/ˈsɑːteɪ/ SAH-tay, in USA also /ˈsæteɪ/ SA-tay), or sate in Indonesian and Malay spelling, is a Southeast Asian dish of seasoned, skewered and grilled meat, served with a sauce. A wide variety of satay peanut sauce options are available to you Sate or satay is a national grilling/bbq dish in Indonesia. There are many variants of sate from Sabang (West) to Merauke (East) with many different sauce or gravy to be served with. After being upset due to the food picture theft, I decided to renew the picture of sate pentul.
