How do I bake a Mug Cake? The banana bread is small enough for two and if you only have two ripe bananas to use, it&#39;s perfect. I made the banana bread in a Philips Airfryer and it&#39;s fast, easy, and you don&#39;t need a mixer. We love banana bread around here, and make it pretty often.

Mostly because whenever we buy bananas, we don&#39;t eat them, and they turn brown, so I stuff them in the freezer to save for baking. Divide batter among two bread pans that have been sprayed with cooking spray. Unlike the other reviews it DID bake all the way through perfectly. I might try just dumping it all in the machine next time. It needs only regular pantry items, too.
