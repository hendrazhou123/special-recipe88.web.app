- "300 g Red shiso leaves if you have"

- "Place the plums in a clean jar, add the salt and mix well with a sanitized spatula or your hands with gloves on to make sure that inside of the jar is kept clean. Put plastic wrap over the plums (making it stick to the surface of the plums) and put a drop lid or flat plate on the plastic wrap. Then put 4kg weight on the plate.

- "Place the leaves into a clean bowl, add 1 cup of plum juice from the jar, mix well and put it back on top of plums in the jar. Put plastic wrap over it again (making the wrap stick to the surface of the shiso leaves) and put back the drop rid or flat plate on. No need to put the weight this time. If the jar has it&#39;s own lid, put the lid on."
- "When the rainy season is over (a few weeks later from the red shiso is added to the jar), take all the plums and the red shiso leaves out from the jar, place them onto sieves or flat strainer and let them spread over sieves in a single layer. Let them sun dry, from a few hours, up to 3 days."
- "Please keep the liquid. we call it ume-zu(plum vinegar) and you can use it for cooking as you use vinegar for your cooking."
- "The dried plums should be kept in a sanitized jar with lid and will remain good for many years. Put the dried shiso leaves in a food processor and make it into coarse powder, then it&#39;ll be delicious furikake seasonings. (Furikake is toppings for rice. You can sprinkle furikake on your rice)"
