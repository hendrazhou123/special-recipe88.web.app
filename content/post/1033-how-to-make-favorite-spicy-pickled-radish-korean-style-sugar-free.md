recipeinstructions:
- "I soaked my radish in the fridge in water before I made the recipe. Threw away the water before I added the vinegar. So no need to dilute your vinegar unless you want to reduce tanginess. Add water according to your preference."
- "Combine all ingredients in a container. If you are using all of the radish, make sure the vinegar is enough to reach the radish on the top. Adjust according to sweetness or tanginess, recommended ratio is 1:1 if you are using real sugar (or less if you don&#39;t like it too sweet). I used Stevia packets, which is sweeter so I used less. To make it spicy, any Gochujang brand is okay. Don&#39;t forget to add salt."
- "Refrigerate overnight and enjoy it the following day. :)"
