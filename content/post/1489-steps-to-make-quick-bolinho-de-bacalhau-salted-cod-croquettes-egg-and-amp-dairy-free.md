recipeinstructions:

- "Drain soaked Cod. Add the Soy Milk, Water &amp; Cod to a large pot, (make sure Cod is completely submerged, add extra water if you need) bring to the boil then turn down heat and simmer for 30 min."
- "Peel Potatoes, boil til extremely tender, drain, mash Potatoes (leave no lumps), set aside to cool down to room temperature."
- "Roast Garlic skin on, cool down, remove skin off the Garlic then squash the Garlic to a paste using the flat side of your knife, (You can use a spoon instead) add into a large mixing bowl."
- "Finely chop Parsley &amp; add to the mixing bowl."
- "Add a generous amount of cracked Pepper to mixing bowl. (As the Cod is rather salty don&#39;t add the Salt until you taste it)"
- "Drain and rinse the Cod in cold water until the Cod is cool at the touch, drain and add to a paper towel and pat down dry. Remove scales and bones. Using a fork squash the Cod on a chopping board until it looks like fairy floss and then add to the mixing bowl."

- "Slice lemons. Add the drained Croquettes to a serving bowl and serve immediately with sliced lemons."
- "EXTRA HINTS: Add Onions; Saute onions and add to mixture! The Soy Milk (Traditionally Milk is used, I don&#39;t consume dairy but please use Milk if you would like) helps to tender the Cod fish. This recipe traditionally uses 3 eggs, (I don&#39;t eat egg hence the &#34;Tapioca Powder&#34; it acts as a binder), but feel free to use egg if you would like! This make a great snack at any time of the day as they are absolutely and extremely MORISH!!!"
