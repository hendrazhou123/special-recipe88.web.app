These paleo vanilla cupcakes are so light, fluffy, moist, and sweet that you&#39;d never guess they&#39;re gluten free, dairy free and paleo! The &#34;buttercream&#34; frosting is easy to whip up, and tastes just like the original even though it contains no refined sugar or dairy. Kid approved and perfect for birthdays.
