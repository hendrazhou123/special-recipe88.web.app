recipeingredient:
- "1 cup your fave peanut butter"
- "1 lg egg white"
- "3/4 cup lightly packed lt brown sugar"
- "1 tsp maple flavoring optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "In a med bowl combine ALL ings except the egg white, while the oven heats to 350°F (180°C). Once they&#39;re well mixed, sugar isn&#39;t visible, add the egg white. You&#39;ll notice the batter seizes and becomes harder to stir. Do so just enough so the egg white is incorporated and isn&#39;t visible."
- "Use a Tbsp scoop of some kind to place scoops of batter 1&#34; or so apart on a rimmed baking sheet, press with a fork crosswise and place on a middle rack to bake for 7 - 9 mins for barely soft to crispy on the outside cookies."
- "Use a spatula to remove these after 5 - 10 mins to a cooling rack. Be aware that because these don&#39;t have any flour, and therefore no gluten for structure, they&#39;re crumbly. They&#39;re also FULL of protein from the peanut butter AND the egg white. So enjoy!!"
- "VERY optional: bake an 8 x 8 pan lined with parchment paper, LIGHTLY coated with an oil like coconut or sesame that won&#39;t burn or alter the taste of the pb. Add choc chips of your choice, or not. Bake at 350°F (180°C) for 35 mins or so, until a tester comes out clean, or the edges look solid. It&#39;ll harden as it cools. Take out with edges of paper to cool on cooling rack. Enjoy!!"
