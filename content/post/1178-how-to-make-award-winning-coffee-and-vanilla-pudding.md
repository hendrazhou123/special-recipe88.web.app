I am a coffee lover, and I found this to be way too strong--it just did not taste good. I think it could be tasty if the espresso powder is cut back. Milk: Whole milk is the base of the pudding. Sugar: Regular granulated sugar sweetens the pudding. Thickener: Egg yolks and cornstarch thicken up the pudding.
