Again, let your dietary needs guide your way! Crunchy peanut butter is important for a bit of textural contrast, and when it comes to the jam, I always reach for something with a good amount of acidity. I build it so that both sides have peanut butter and then the jelly is in the middle. It&#39;s a more symmetrical bite and you&#39;re not getting any preserves.
