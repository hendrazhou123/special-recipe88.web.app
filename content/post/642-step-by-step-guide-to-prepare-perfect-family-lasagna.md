- "Begin building your lasagna.  In a lasagna dish I start off with spreading a layer of ricotta cheese. Next a layer of noodles. Next a layer of sauce. Next I sprinkle my grated Parmesan cheese. Next I spread an even layer of mozzarella cheese.  I repeat this process for about a total of four layers or depending on how deep your lasagna dish."
- "Place lasagna dish in preheated heat 375 degrees oven for about 20 to 25 minutes or until the top layer of mozzarella cheese forms a speckled golden brown, bubbly and delicious looking crust."
