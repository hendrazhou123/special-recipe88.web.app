recipeinstructions:

- "Cut up the softened butter into small cubes, add to flour mixture and rub until you have yourself crumble mixture. Spread out on baking sheet and bake in oven for about 15 minutes, or until it looks, and smells, good. Take out and let cool on baking sheet."

- "Put raspberries and figs under the oven grill until soft, but not completely mushy. Take out, let cool and cut figs into wedges (aim for 6 wedges per full fig, so three per half). Keep all the juices that came off on the side."
- "Divide the yoghurt over your favorite bowls, spread the fig wedges around the edge, toss in the raspberries, drizzle over the juice left over from grilling."
- "sprinkle over the crumble, grab a spoon and finish bowls to the bottom."

I like it warm with a side of vanilla ice cream. Figs are in season right now - tender, mildly sweet bites of summer. A few nicks here and there told me the skin was fragile - one telltale sign of ripeness. After a quick boil in honey and a pucker of balsamic vinegar, the figs find the perfect sweet/tart balance.
