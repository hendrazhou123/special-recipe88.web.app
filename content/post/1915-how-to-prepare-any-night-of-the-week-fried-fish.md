Wondering how to stop fish sticking to the pan? It&#39;s easy: use a heavy based skillet (doesn&#39;t need to be non stick), heat the pan before adding. This tasty fried fish recipe is made with a basic combination of flour and seasonings, but don&#39;t be fooled by the simplicity of this dishâ€”the fillets fry up crispy and delicious. Haddock and cod are two excellent choices for fried fish, but tilapia , pollock , or another mild white fish should work fine. It would also taste great served on a bun with tartar sauce and a slice of cheese (so go ahead and ditch the drive-thru).
