- "Cook bacon at 350 to 375 degrees checking and turning after the first 10 minutes, and every 5 minutes there after until it&#39;s as crispy as you want it."
- "Now here&#39;s where my Saturday work ethic kicks in... One already messy pan and a pile of burgers left to cook. A preheated oven... I did it, I confess... I cooled the pan for a couple minutes, plopped those uncooked patties on, and I cooked them in the oven."
- "My modest little burgers didn&#39;t take long, and got flipped about halfway through. I can not help you with cooking time here, because I don&#39;t know your burger size or ingredients.. Sorry...

- "Hot, hot, hot skillet for a couple minutes and you&#39;ve upgraded those bland store bought buns."
- "Now here&#39;s where things get new and exciting for your burger world. First cheese, which is a duh and why is this woman wasting my time... But wait! Then comes...."
- "Peanut butter and spicy Thai sauce. The red sauce here is our favorite brand of store bought Thai chili sauce. You want that sweet and spicy combo."
- "Onto the sweet and spicy burger, put some salty bacon:)"
- "I didn&#39;t get a final pick, I was too excited about eating it! Hope you enjoy!"
