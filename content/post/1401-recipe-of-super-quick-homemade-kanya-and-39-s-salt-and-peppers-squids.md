Salt and Pepper Squid is one of my childhood weekend treats that I remember most fondly. My dad would marinate the squid rings with Shaoxing wine and tons of ginger. Then he&#39;d coat them with a simple batter seasoned with salt and pepper, frying them until they were a beautiful golden yellow. Garlic, salt, pepper, coriander and fresh peppers successfully motivate the aroma while decrease the fishy taste. Then rinse well and dry with kitchen paper.
