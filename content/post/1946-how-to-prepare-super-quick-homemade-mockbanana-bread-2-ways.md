Mostly because whenever we buy bananas, we don&#39;t eat them, and they turn brown, so I stuff them in the freezer to save for baking. Divide batter among two bread pans that have been sprayed with cooking spray. Unlike the other reviews it DID bake all the way through perfectly. I might try just dumping it all in the machine next time. It needs only regular pantry items, too.
