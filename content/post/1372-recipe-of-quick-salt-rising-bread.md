recipeingredient:
- "3 large baking potatoes"
- "3 tbsp NOT DEgerminated yellow cornmeal"
- "1 tsp sugar"
- "1 tsp salt"
- "4 cup boiling water"
- "2 cup warm milk"
- "1 cup warm water"
- "1/2 tsp baking soda"
- "2 tsp salt"
- "2 tbsp vegetable oil OR melted shortening"
- "5 lb bag of bread flour"
recipeinstructions:
- "Wash and peel potatoes. Slice raw potatoes thinly into a large, non-reactive bowl (I use Tupperware; ceramic also works). Sprinkle with cornmeal, sugar and salt and pour on the boiling water. Cover the bowl loosely with plastic wrap and set aside."
- "Fill a crockpot half full of water, heat that up on high, then turn it down to low. Invert the crockpot lid, set a dinner plate on top of that with a pot holder or 2, place your bowl of starter ingredients on top, and cover the whole thing with a couple of thick bath towels. The trick to a successful starter is keeping it at a constant temperature of 100-105-degrees."
- "After 12 to 15 hours your starter should be foamy (see photo) and have a strong, sour smell (kind of like stinky feet). If after 12 to 15 hours the starter isn&#39;t foamy and stinky, the starter has failed. Do not continue with the recipe. You must have the foam and the smell!"
- "Now in a separate bowl, mix together the warm milk, (even skim is fine), warm water, baking soda, salt and melted shortening or oil."
- "Drain the potato mixture in a colander saving the starter liquid (discard the potato slices) and mix the starter liquid with the milk &amp; water mixture. Stir in enough flour to make smooth dough."
- "Knead until smooth and elastic as you would for yeast dough, about 8 to 10 minutes, adding more flour as needed to prevent stickiness."
- "Divide the kneaded dough into 6 greased 1 pound small loaf (8 x 4) pans. Dough should fill pan 1/3 full."
- "Lightly cover the bread pans with a floured tea towel or a sheet of plastic wrap that&#39;s been lightly sprayed with Pam. Let the breads rise in a consistent warm place until dough has almost doubled. (About 2 hours)."
- "With a fine-misting spray bottle, spritz the top of the dough with water. Bake in a 400Â°F oven for 30 minutes or until golden."
- "Remove to racks to cool. Brush tops of loaves with melted butter."
- "The characteristic strong odor you smell as the bread is baking will not overly manifest itself in the flavor of the bread. The bread has a nice grain and texture and pleasant taste and is MOST delicious when toasted! It also freezes very well."
- "UPDATE 7/25/17: FINALLY found a bakery (in Pennsylvania) that sells authentic Salt Rising Bread. Somewhat pricey with shipping (but worth it), BUT they also sell a dried starter that makes it a bit easier to make your own. Also recently got a sous vide gadget and found it much easier to use than the crockpot to maintain the consistent temperature for a successful starter."
- "UPDATE 5/11/2020: Recently ordered from the PA bakery mentioned in comment 12, and, sadly, it&#39;s no longer the authentic salt rising recipe. ðŸ˜¢"

Salt-rising bread is a specific type of bread that does not use yeast, and instead uses another source of bacteria to create the gases that allow bread dough to rise. The origins of salt-rising bread are unclear but seem to lie in the nineteenth-century American frontier, where it was likely difficult to obtain fresh yeast or keep a bread starter cool and regularly fed. This old-fashioned method of making bread with a cornmeal starter is worth the effort! Salt-rising bread, whose rising depends upon neither salt nor yeast, became their solution. Pioneers cultivated bacteria in the potatoes or cornmeal that they mixed with flour to make a funky, fresh loaf.
