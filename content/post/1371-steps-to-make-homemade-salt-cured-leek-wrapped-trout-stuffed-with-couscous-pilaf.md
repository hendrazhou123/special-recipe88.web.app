A blog about cured meats, how to cure meats, make your own charcuterie and salumi. The other method is what I (and others) call &#34;equilibrium curing&#34; in which a calculated quantity of salt is added to the meat, with the spices, and allowing enough time for the meat to absorb all the salt. Curing salts may seem like a very specialized subject. But once you get a taste for smoking, then curing your own bacon or prosciutto is a natural progression. The ability to make your own delicious pastrami, country style ham or corned beef from scratch is definitely a &#34;next level&#34; skill.
