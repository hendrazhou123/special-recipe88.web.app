That&#39;s got nothing to do with food. The vanilla cream is what makes the difference. For some reason bomboloni taste waaaaay better than any of the vanilla cream filled Berliner (or Krapfen how they are called here) These simply don&#39;t taste as good as their Italian. Bombolini, or Italian-style donuts, are one of my favorite sweet snacks. The rich Nutella filling perfectly complements the soft and fluffy dough.
