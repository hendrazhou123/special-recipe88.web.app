Fantastic, easy, simple gorgeous no bake cheesecake that omits the cheese and only uses condensed milk and cream for the filing. The recipe was originally given to me by my mother-in-law. A No Bake Cheesecake is just that, the filling is not baked in the oven. But don&#39;t worry, this cheesecake still has that rich and tangy flavor of cream cheese, and it is still smooth and creamy.
