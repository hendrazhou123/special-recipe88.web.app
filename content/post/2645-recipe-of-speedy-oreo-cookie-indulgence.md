recipeingredient:
- "2 instant vanilla pudding packages 34oz size"
- "3 cup milk"
- "2 143oz bags of original oreos"
- "2 tbsp Cocoa powder"
- "1 tsp vanilla"
- "1/2 cup powdered sugar"
- "8 oz cream cheese  take out of fridge for an hour"
- "15 oz Cool whip take out of freezer for an hour"
recipeinstructions:
- "Add instant pudding to a large bowl with milk.  With a hand mixer, blend until it stiffens."
- "Add cocoa powder, vanilla, cream cheese and powdered sugar.  Mix until lumps are gone."
- "Add cool whip and mix again until creamy and smooth. Set aside."
- "Take 1 bag of oreo cookies and add to a large zip loc bag, let the air out and seal shut.  With a rolling pin,  crush the oreos until they are crumbled into little pieces.  This will take a couple minutes.  Or you can add to a food processor and pulse to get this texture.  It&#39;s not fine crumbs, but little chunks of cookies AND crumbles."
- "In a 13x9 clear baking dish, add a layer of crumbles, so you don&#39;t see the bottom of the dish."
- "Take a few spoonfuls of the cream mix and place throughout the cookie crumbs.  You need to slowly and gently spread the mix so you don&#39;t disturb the cookie crumbles. It&#39;s about half the mix."
- "Add another layer of the cookie crumbles over the cream mix until you can&#39;t see the cream mix.  You might need to crush more cookies,  that&#39;s why I have 2 bags of oreos in the recipe."
- "Add another layer of the cream mix and top with more cookie crumbles.  I save a cookie to garnish so people know it&#39;s an oreo dish."
- "Cover with foil and refridgerate for 5 hours or over night."
- "You will be labeling out spoonfuls of this dish as servings.  You can&#39;t cut it into pieces,  Just spoon it out into a bowl!"
- "You can do chocolate pudding if you&#39;d like, but i like the contrast of colors because you can see the layers in the dish.  I don&#39;t like to over power the chocolate flavor of the oreos."
