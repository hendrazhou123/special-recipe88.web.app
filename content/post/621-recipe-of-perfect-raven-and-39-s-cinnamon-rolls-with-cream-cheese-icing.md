- "With serated knife, pizza cutter or dental floss, cut rolls into 12 to 15 pieces."

- "Spread half of the icing over hot rolls as soon as they come out of oven. This melts into nooks and crannies and is delicious!"
- "When slightly cooled but still warm, spread the rest of icing over warm rolls."
- "I hope you enjoy these as much as I do :)"
