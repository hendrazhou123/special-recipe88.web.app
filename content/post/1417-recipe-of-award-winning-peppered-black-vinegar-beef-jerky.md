Sprinkle with coarsely ground black pepper. Sucky days and epic battles have always been a thing. Marinated in our signature seasoning blend with an added kick of ground black pepper, it&#39;s then slow cooked over. Slowly-marinated beef strips dry into savory pieces of peppery beef jerky in a food dehydrator. For safety, it&#39;s best to cook the strips first before drying.
