I grew up in a house I know I already have a decadent Baked Spasagna on this blog which is a mix between spaghetti and lasagna , but this Baked Spaghetti with ricotta. I will describe Baked Spaghetti as a simple Spaghetti dish topped with a rich béchamel sauce and baked to perfection. I love having baked spaghetti especially if there is a slice of buttery toast bread in my plate. This can be added as a comfort food in my list.
