recipeingredient:
- "12 tbsp sugar"
- "2 cup heavy whipping cream"
- "6 large egg yolks"
- "4 oz White baking chocolate finely chopped"
- "1/2 vanilla bean"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 325°F. whisk the egg yolks and 4 tablespoons of sugar together in a medium mixing bowl."
- "Heat the white chocolate, cream, vanilla bean seeds. and 4 tablespoons of sugar over low heat. I like to add the seeded vanilla bean to the mixture while the chocolate is melting for a little extra vanilla flavor. Just warm the mixture enough to melt the chocolate fully stirring constantly. Don&#39;t boil."
- "Remove the chocolate mixture from heat. Remove the vanilla bean if used from the chocolate mixture. Stir in a small amount of the warm chocolate mixture into the egg yolk mixture a small amount at a time to keep the eggs from scrambling stirring constantly."
- "Pour the mixture into four 7 ounce ramekins.  Place the ramekins in in a 16 by 9 baking dish add one inch of boiling water to the baking dish. Bake uncovered for 50 to 55 minutes or until the center is set."
- "Remove ramekins from water bath and let cool on a hot pad for 30 minutes. Then refridgerate for 3 to 4 hours. Remove from refrigerator 30 minutes before serving. Just before serving place the remaining sugar over the top of each of the dishes. About a tablespoon each. You can either use a torch or the broiler on your oven to caramelized the sugar. I recommend the torch but if you place the  dishes on a baking get sheet about 5 inches from the broiler and bet for about 3 minutes that should do the trick. Remember to watch carefully if you are using the broiler."
- "I like to use fresh berries on top but they are not required. My favorite is raspberries but blueberries and strawberries are great too."
