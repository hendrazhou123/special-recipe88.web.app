recipeinstructions:

- "Once the dough is mixed ( for extra mix I would hand mix for a minute or two.)"

- "After about 15 mins, less if you like them soft, take them out and let them cool for a while, they will firm up. Dont worry if they look too soft when taking them out, they firm up quite a bit when. They are out of the heat."
