recipeingredient:
- " Cookie dough peanut butter or chocolate chip"
- " Nonstick spray"
- "bar Chocolate chips or Hershey kiss or Hershey candy"
- "half Large marshmallows cut in"
- " Muffin or mini muffin pan"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 350 spray muffin pan with nonstick spray."
- "Make cookie dough (I cheated and used a bag kind)"
- "Place cookie dough in muffin Pan pressing around the sides And making a thumbprint on the inside in the middle bake until done remove from oven (I used a cookie scoop it was perfect for this.)"
- "Notes- I Had a hard time to telling when the cookies was done, when they started to pull away from the sides and brown up some I removed them remember they go back in the oven I didnâ€™t want a hard crunchy cookie I wanted it soft but not doughy. And if you are like me you forgot to set a timer. They are being done in a muffin pan so I donâ€™t think cooking times will be right with the bag instructions anyways."
- "Add the half cut marshmallow to each one(push them down in the cookie even if it breaks it some.)put it back in the oven till it melts some (I used the boiler for this part and watched it, only took a min or two)remove from oven then top with chocolate chips or a Hershey kiss and remove from pan (notes- if using chocolate chips place them in first then the marshmallow just another option so they donâ€™t fall off the top.)"
- "Remove with butter knife they should pop right on out easy. I only had one that stuck and one that broke coming out Iâ€™d say that pretty darn good. That one bag made 22 cookies in a mini muffin pan. And I used 2 Hershey candy bars not sure how many you will get if using a regular muffin pan, and if using a regular muffin pan I donâ€™t think you would have to cut the marshmallows in half. If anyone trying on a regular muffin pan please let me know so I can make the change on here.."
- "I did pop these back in the oven after I topped it with the chocolate. My oven was off and still warm. This step is optional."
- "Enjoy ðŸ˜‰"
- "Notes- to make less of a mess use chocolate chip cookie dough. And you donâ€™t have to worry about the chocolate."
- "I took so many pictures thatâ€™s how good they are lol."
