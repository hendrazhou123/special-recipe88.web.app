- " Some chopped green onion and cilantro"

recipeinstructions:
- "Do you see how fine the cabbage is? It’s not because I am that good with knives. It is from the help of this gadget. Saw it on Sachie ‘s kitchen. Later I added some julienned carrots, chopped green onion and cilantro with some peanut dressing to go with the ribs."
- "Put garlic, sprinkle salt and pepper on both sides of ribs. Massage the ribs well and let them rest for 10 minutes"

- "Sear the ribs until golden brown with some oil on a pan at high heat. About 3 to 4 minutes for each side."
- "After ribs are golden brown, turn heat to low. Pour the peanut sauce evenly over ribs, put lid on and slowly cooked for 1 hour and 20 minutes. Remember to flip the ribs over from time to time for the seasoning to really get into the meat."
- "After the ribs are done, remove ribs from pan. Strain the dripping from pan into a small saucepan or pot with 2 TBS of peanut sauce. Stir over medium low heat to thicken glaze for about 10 seconds. Turn off heat."
- "For slaw dressing, put 3 TBS of peanut sauce in small bowl. Add little more sugar and the juice of a 3/4 lime. Mix well."
- "Put some slaw and ribs on plate. Drizzle dressing on slaw. Pour some glazing over ribs and sprinkle some crushed peanuts on tops. Go well with all kinds of rice or just like that if you are watching starch intake:)"
- "It was finger licking good to me. Hope you all like it too:)"
