We love sesame bagels, but seed loss was putting us at risk for sprouting a sesame plantation right on the dining room rug. For maximally chewy bagels, remember to use high-gluten flour (or add extra gluten to your regular bread flour) and mix the dough until it&#39;s very strong! Ingredients: Water, Potato Starch, Soya Flour, Tapioca Starch, Brown Rice Flour, Chickpea Flour, Cellulose, Sunflower Oil, Yeast, Rice Syrup, Grape Juice, Potato Fibre, Natural Flavor, Sea Salt, Xanthan Gum, Cultured Rice Flour, Cultured Brown Rice, Brown Rice, White Distilled Vinegar. The next day, you would hand-grind the sweet rice along with water, ONE SPOONFUL AT A TIME by feeding it through the small hole on top of the grinder. Yep. pork suet was used in traditional sweet black sesame balls.
