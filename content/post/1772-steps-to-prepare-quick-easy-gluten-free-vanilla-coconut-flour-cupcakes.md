recipeingredient:
- "2/3 C sugar substitute to taste"
- "1/2 C coconut oil"
- "1/2 tsp salt"
- "2 tsp vanilla extract"
- "6 L eggs"
- "2 tbsp heavy cream"
- "1/2 C coconut flour"
- "1 tsp baking powder"
recipeinstructions:
- "Pre-heat oven to 350° and prepare tins"
- "In a large bowl whip up the coconut oil, sugar, eggs, vanilla, and salt"
- "Whisk in the milk or dairy alternative."
- "In a separate small bowl sift the coconut flour and baking powder"
- "Add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients and mix until combined"
- "Evenly divide the batter and bake for 18 to 20 minutes, until the toothpick comes out clean from the center. I&#39;d advise consistently checking on them. Since they bake quite quickly they can easily get overdone which can suck. I made the mistake of just leaving it in and not checking until the 18 min were up. BIG MISTAKE. I would say maybe check on them at 15 min."
- "Do you smell that heavenly aroma? Mmmm makes you want to gobble &#39;em all up! Make sure to let them cool before you have at it. Perhaps prepare a buttercream frosting... MMMMMM. Enjoy!"
