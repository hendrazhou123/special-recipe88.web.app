recipeinstructions:
- "Line a baking tray with parchment or use a roasting rack (it will go quicker on the rack). Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas 6. Arrange the bacon in the tray in a single layer – you may need to do it in batches. Bake for about 20-25 minutes until crisp."

- "Transfer to a wooden board or fresh sheet of parchment and leave to cool – it should not be tacky to the touch. To serve, cut in halves or thirds. Keep in the fridge on a plate in a single layer, covered loosely with cling film."
