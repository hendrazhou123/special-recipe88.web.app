The brownie bottom still held together as if I hadn&#39;t forgotten the binder ingredient - so I marked it as optional. Bring cream cheese to room temperature. In a blender or food processor, beat all cheesecake ingredients just until smooth.

Chocolate brownies marbled with cheesecake make fabulous squares!
