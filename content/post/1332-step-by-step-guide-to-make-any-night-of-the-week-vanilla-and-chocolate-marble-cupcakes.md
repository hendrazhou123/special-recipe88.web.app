I love a good marble cake. Beginning with the vanilla mixture, place four spoonfuls of batter into the pan, spacing them far enough apart so that you can create a checkerboard when you add the chocolate batter. Spoon the vanilla and chocolate batters into prepared cupcake tins. I like to use cupcake liners. Use a few spoonfuls of each batter in each cup.
