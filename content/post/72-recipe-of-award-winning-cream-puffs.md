Cream puff shells freeze incredibly well! I suggest freezing the shells without filling in them and then allow them to thaw at room temperature for several hours before filling and serving. Notes about the recipe: The moisture in the eggs turns to steam and puffs the batter to try to release itself. Ever wanted to make perfect Cream Puffs at home?
