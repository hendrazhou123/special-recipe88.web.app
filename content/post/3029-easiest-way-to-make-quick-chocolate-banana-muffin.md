Socially acceptable for breakfast, but decadent enough for dessert. üòâ Double chocolate banana muffins, because we could all use a little something sweet in our lives. üôÇ This is the best banana chocolate chip muffin recipe if you ask me! They come together quickly and they are super easy to make. Just mix all the dry ingredient in one bowl (flour, baking soda, salt, and sugar), and the rest of the ingredients in another bowl, then mix the two mixtures together. Given these are light and fluffy, not dense with a tight crumb like a typical banana muffin or banana bread, this would be one to remember when you want a banana cake (um, with chocolate frosting). These dark chocolate banana muffins are supremely moist and fudgy, packed with double the chocolate in the form of both chocolate chips (inside and on top) and cocoa powder (a lot), and their high-rise domed tops are prime for picking, munching, and licking off your fingers. 

So that is going to wrap it up for this special food chocolate banana muffin recipe. Thanks so much for reading. I am sure you will make this at home.
