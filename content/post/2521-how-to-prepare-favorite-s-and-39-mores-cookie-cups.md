recipeingredient:
- "1 1/4 cup all purpose flour"
- "1 cup Graham cracker crumbs about 7 whole crackers"
- "1/2 tsp. baking soda"
- "1/2 tsp. salt"
- "3/4 cup (1.5 sticks) unsalted butter softened to room temp"
- "3/4 cup brown sugar"
- "1/4 cup granulated sugar"
- "1 large egg at room temperature"
- "1 tsp. vanilla extract"
- "16 Marshmallows for serving regular size"
- "32 small Hershey chocolate bar squares for serving"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease a mini muffin pan (this will make more than 1 batch, so if you have two mini muffin pans, grease 8 tins of the second pan) and set aside."
- "Pulse up the Graham crackers in a food processor until they break down into crumbs. You&#39;ll need about 7 full cracker sheets to equal out to 1 cup of crumbs. Transfer the Graham cracker crumbs to a medium mixing bowl, then add the flour, baking soda and salt. Whisk it all together and then set it aside."
- "In a large bowl, beat the butter using a hand mixer until it&#39;s creamy, then beat in the brown sugar and granulated sugar until it&#39;s combined. Beat in the egg and the vanilla extract."
- "With the mixer going, add the dry ingredients to the wet until they are fully combined. Scrape down the side of the bowl with a rubber spatula as needed."
- "Roll up balls of dough, about 1 tbsp. of dough per ball, and place the dough balls into the greased mini muffin tins."
- "Bake 1 batch at a time for 16-20 minutes, until the edges are lightly browned and the cookies appear set. Let the finished cookie cups cool in the pan for 5 or so minutes, then pop them out and place them on a wire rack to cool completely."
- "I would recommend only doing the marshmallow and chocolate toppings right before serving, as the marshmallows don&#39;t store all that well once they&#39;re toasted. Store the cookie cups in a large Tupperware for 4-5 days."
- "For serving, place the amount you&#39;d like to prepare on a foil lined baking sheet. Set the oven to broil. Slice a marshmallow in half and place half a marshmallow over each cookie cup. Broil just until the marshmallow starts to turn golden, about a minute or so...be sure to keep an eye on the pan, as they can burn easily. As soon as they&#39;re out of the oven, top each with a little wedge of Hershey&#39;s chococate then serve immediately."
