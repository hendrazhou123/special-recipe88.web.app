Here we brine the potatoes before baking them. We don&#39;t know why this works, but brined potatoes seem to turn out fluffier inside.

I confess that the Instant Pot used to be our go-to for baking potatoes. Baked potatoes can be incredibly simple and delicious, but they can be incredibly bland and boring, too. Wash potato (or potatoes) thoroughly with a stiff brush and cold running water. Russet potatoes make the best baked potatoes because of their thick skin and starchy, fluffy interior (once baked). Leave the waxy potatoes for roasting.
