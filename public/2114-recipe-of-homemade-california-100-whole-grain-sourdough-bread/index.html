<p>To get started with this recipe, we have to first prepare a few ingredients. You can cook california 100% whole grain sourdough bread using 4 ingredients and 11 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-california-100-whole-grain-sourdough-bread">The ingredients needed to make California 100% Whole Grain Sourdough Bread:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Take  Sourdough Starter</li>
<li>Make ready  Flour</li>
<li>Get  Water</li>
<li>Prepare  Salt</li>
</ol>
<p>Registered dietitian Andy De Santis breaks down each option and reveals which type of bread you should be reaching for. I have used a number of whole wheat flour to make this bread, both commercially ground and home ground. Thanks to its shape, it's also known as coffee tin bread. Traditionally, folks made it in tall, skinny canisters — and later on, in tin coffee cans.</p>

<h5 id="steps-to-make-california-100-whole-grain-sourdough-bread">Steps to make California 100% Whole Grain Sourdough Bread:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Day 1 - Find a plastic or glass container to build, feed, and keep your starter.  - Mix: - •	3 tbsp of starter (Sourdough starter, or build your own with 4 tbsp of flour and 2 tbsp of water – mix and store in closed container for 12-24 hours at room temperature or until you see bubbles - then use it for this recipe) - •	3 tbsp of water - •	3 tbsp of flour - Rest: for 12 hours - The starter will become active and form bubbles, and it will smell like sourdough due to the fermentation process.</li>

<p>I got some questions regarding whether the same thing. I love love love rustic breads made with whole grains only - toasted crisp in the morning with a big pat of fresh butter. Nutrient dense, full of fiber and easily digestible because of natural fermentation, a slice of real whole. Two and one-half Dave runs his bakehouse out of his garage in Chico, California and has a passion for ancient grains. Have you ever tried whole grain bread?</p>
<p>So that is going to wrap it up for this special food california 100% whole grain sourdough bread recipe. Thank you very much for your time. I&rsquo;m sure that you will make this at home. There is gonna be more interesting food in home recipes coming up. Remember to bookmark this page on your browser, and share it to your loved ones, friends and colleague. Thank you for reading. Go on get cooking!</p>
