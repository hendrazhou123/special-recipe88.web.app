<p>Hello everybody, it is Jim, welcome to my recipe site. Today, I will show you a way to make a special dish, whole wheat &amp; gram flour (besan) bread. It is one of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I am going to make it a bit unique. This is gonna smell and look delicious.</p>
<p>Whole Wheat &amp; Gram Flour (Besan) Bread is one of the most popular of recent trending foods in the world. It is appreciated by millions daily. It&rsquo;s easy, it&rsquo;s quick, it tastes delicious. They are fine and they look fantastic. Whole Wheat &amp; Gram Flour (Besan) Bread is something which I&rsquo;ve loved my entire life.</p>
<p>Whole-wheat flour (in the US) or wholemeal flour (in the UK) is a powdery substance, a basic food ingredient, derived by grinding or mashing the whole grain of wheat, also known as the wheatberry. Whole-wheat flour is used in baking of breads and other baked goods. Learn more in the Cambridge English-Russian Dictionary.</p>
<p>To get started with this recipe, we must prepare a few ingredients. You can have whole wheat &amp; gram flour (besan) bread using 12 ingredients and 21 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-whole-wheat-amp-gram-flour-besan-bread">The ingredients needed to make Whole Wheat &amp; Gram Flour (Besan) Bread:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Prepare 1.5 Cup Whole Wheat Flour</li>
<li>Get 1 Cup Gram Flour (Besan)</li>
<li>Prepare 1/2 Cup Vital Wheat Gluten Flour (optional but recommended, if not using, then replace with whole wheat flour)</li>
<li>Take 1/2 Cup Milk Powder</li>

<p>Whole wheat refers to the flour obtained when the wheat grain (including bran, germ and endosperm) is ground or mashed to make bread or roti. Whole-wheat flour can be used interchangeably for white whole-wheat flour called for in a recipe, or it can be substituted for half the amount of all-purpose flour in a recipe. Durum wheat and whole wheat are two of the most popular species of wheat and often used in foods like bread, pasta, noodles, couscous, and baked goods. Yet, you may wonder how they differ.</p>
