<p>Hey everyone, it&rsquo;s Louise, welcome to our recipe page. Today, I will show you a way to make a special dish, sage brown butter biscuits. One of my favorites. This time, I&rsquo;m gonna make it a little bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.</p>
<p>Sage Brown Butter Biscuits is one of the most favored of recent trending meals on earth. It is simple, it&rsquo;s fast, it tastes delicious. It&rsquo;s appreciated by millions every day. They&rsquo;re fine and they look fantastic. Sage Brown Butter Biscuits is something which I&rsquo;ve loved my whole life.</p>
<p>Sage, thyme, and nutty, flavorful browned butter make these biscuits extra special and they're easier to make than you might think. Browning the butter takes just a few minutes and then it's just a matter of chopping the herbs and combining the ingredients. The herbs steep in the brown butter as it cools.</p>
<p>To get started with this particular recipe, we have to prepare a few ingredients. You can cook sage brown butter biscuits using 9 ingredients and 13 steps. Here is how you can achieve that.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-sage-brown-butter-biscuits">The ingredients needed to make Sage Brown Butter Biscuits:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Prepare 2-1/2 cups flour</li>
<li>Make ready 1 tbsp baking powder</li>
<li>Prepare 1/2 tsp salt</li>
<li>Prepare 1/4 tsp baking soda</li>
<li>Get 1 cup cold butter (1 stick)</li>
<li>Get 4 tbsp chopped fresh sage (dry ok)</li>
<li>Take 3/4 cup half and half or whole milk</li>
<li>Get 1 tsp lemon juice or white vinegar</li>
<li>Make ready 1 egg and 1 tbsp water or milk whisked together to create an egg wash for the biscuits</li>
</ol>
<p>The browned butter gives an amazing depth of flavor that you just can't get any other way. I personally think biscuits need to be served almost immediately after baking, but if you make these a few hours beforehand and then reheat them quickly in the oven, they will still be fab. Brown Butter Sage reminds me of caramelized onions in that it can take a dish from run-of-the-mill to gourmet. You can use brown butter sage on pretty much any dish.</p>
