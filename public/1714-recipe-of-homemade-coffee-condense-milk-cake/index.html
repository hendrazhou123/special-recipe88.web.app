<p>Hey everyone, it&rsquo;s Brad, welcome to our recipe page. Today, I will show you a way to make a special dish, coffee condense milk cake. One of my favorites food recipes. For mine, I am going to make it a little bit tasty. This will be really delicious.</p>
<p>Coffee Condense Milk Cake is one of the most favored of recent trending meals in the world. It&rsquo;s simple, it&rsquo;s quick, it tastes delicious. It is appreciated by millions daily. Coffee Condense Milk Cake is something which I&rsquo;ve loved my entire life. They&rsquo;re fine and they look fantastic.</p>
<p>(Coffee) Sweetened Condensed Milk Buttercream FrostingA Beautiful Mess. This cake is lovely with a cup of tea, not too sweet,moist and. I also discovered that I was out of icing sugar so I lightly buttered the crust and then sprinkled brown sugar on- almost a mock coffee cake at this point.</p>
<p>To get started with this recipe, we must first prepare a few components. You can cook coffee condense milk cake using 11 ingredients and 15 steps. Here is how you cook that.</p>

<script></script>
<h5 id="the-ingredients-needed-to-make-coffee-condense-milk-cake">The ingredients needed to make Coffee Condense Milk Cake:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Make ready  Yolk batter:</li>
<li>Make ready 80 gr butter</li>
<li>Make ready 120 gr cake flour</li>
<li>Prepare 120 ml condense milk</li>
<li>Prepare 1/2 tsp salt</li>
<li>Get 1 tsp vanilla essence</li>
<li>Make ready 1/2 tbs instant coffee powder</li>
<li>Prepare 8 egg yolks</li>
<li>Make ready  White egg batter:</li>
<li>Get 6 egg white</li>
<li>Make ready 6 tbs granulated sugar</li>
</ol>
<p>Because the cake is so rich and sweet, it only needs a simple topping. Many people like to do a simple Lemon Drizzle too which is just a combination of sifted icing sugar with fresh lemon juice. This sweetened condensed milk pound cake is moist, dense and lightly sweet. It's perfect served for breakfast (along with some delicious Millstone Coffee of course!) - and it's also wonderful served for dessert with fruit or any other kind of sweet topping.</p>
