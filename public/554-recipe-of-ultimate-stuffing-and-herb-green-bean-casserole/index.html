It's a beloved casserole favorite that has been diluted over the years to include cans cream of mushroom soup. No Thanksgiving feast is complete without one. I remembered seeing this cheesy green bean and stuffing casserole in Kraft's Food &amp; Family magazine a few years back (okay, so I'm slow) and really liked the idea of a stuffing topped green bean casserole. Or, I guess, technically this would be a dressing topped casserole since it's not.</p>
