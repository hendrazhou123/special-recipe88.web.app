<p>To break the rule about white Bread (is wunderbar) Does the recipe work using a bread. There's just something we love about homemade cornbread in the fall. Paired with a bowl of chili, topped with pinto beans or just cooked to golden brown perfection in a cast iron skillet, cornbread. Egg yolk makes the rolls shine and I love it but it is not necessary. These homemade rolls without yeast are great on the day they are baked.</p>
